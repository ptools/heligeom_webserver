      <h5 class="header lbt-grey-text" id="screw">Screw organization</h5>

      <p>
      A regularly organized oligomer is uniquely defined by the geometry of interaction between
      neighboring subunits (where the subunit can be a peptide, a protein or a protein assembly).<br>
      A regular oligomeric assembly necessarily follows a screw organization : it can form either a helix
      (rotation around an axis coupled to a translation along this axis), a ring or a straight assembly
      along the axis.<br>
      The helix is the general case, it is characterized by helical parameters such as the pitch, the
      number of monomers per turn and the handedness. A cyclic oligomer is a special case of screw
      assembly, where the pitch is null. The straight assembly is a special case of screw assembly,
      where the rotation around the axis is null.<br>
      An interface geometry between subunits uniquely defines a 3D organization in terms of pitch and
      number of monomers per turn. The contrary is not necessarily true.<br>

      <h5 class="header lbt-grey-text" id="interfaces">Interfaces</h5>

      <p>
        A binding geometry can be characterized by a set of pairs of amino-acid in contact across the
        interface. Oligomers are considered to participate to a same family in terms of interface if they
        share a sufficient ratio of contact pairs. <br>
        This ratio is called f<sub>NAT</sub> (fraction of NATive contacts) due to
        its historical definition in folding studies, but it can be used with profit to characterize the similarity
        of alternative interfaces.
